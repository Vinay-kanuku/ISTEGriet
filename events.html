                                explained about the Typing Test Approach in AI.
                                HeHe also explained about the difference between
                                human brain and an AI machine by using simple

                                Artificial Intelligence researches are going on
                                and what improvements we can do to the society
                                by using AI.

                                Coding is an essential part of today’s world

                                came up with an event called code auction season
                                2 after the tremendous success of season 1.
                                Participants flocked in large numbers with
                                around 110 students. Questions were prepared on
                                coding and they were auctioned off to the
                                participants who were seated in a team of 3. The
                                auction went off very well and the participants
                                enjoyed a lot solving the technical questions.

                                complex scientific instruments. Due to its

                                and applications. In order to prove that it’s a
                                great tool for the students ISTE Student chapter

                                basic electronic and electrical concepts. Around
                                60 students participated in the session. The
                                session started with a detailed introduction of
                                how an Arduino works and later with the
                                advantages of it. The students were filled with

                                It is estimated that there are around 1.75
                                billion smart phone users worldwide and more
                                than 100 billion apps have been downloaded only
                                from the apple app store till It date. These
                                increasing numbers have caught the eye of
                                today’s generation and many have decided to
                                contribute to these growing numbers. Sometimes
                                students may have very interesting ideas but
                                they hesitate to share them because of fear of
                                rejection and failure. <br /><br />
                                In order to break this taboo the ISTE Student
                                Chapter conducted an event called‘DESIGN SPRINT’
                                on <b>30th July,2015</b>.The main objective in
                                conducting this event was to bringout the
                                ingenious ideas hidden among the students. The
                                event started of with the participants designing
                                the basic structure of an application. The
                                students worked in teams of four to design the
                                layout of an app along with the special features
                                it provides under the guidance of the technical
                                leads of ISTE Student Chapter. Later the
                                students were given an opportunity to present
                                their ideas to the audience which helped them in
                                conquering stage fear.Informal feedback from the
                                audience was positive. They said that it was
                                really a new learning experience as they got to
                                work in a teams and came to know about the apps
                                designed by other students as well. <br /><br />
                                Out of all the 23 teams that came up with
